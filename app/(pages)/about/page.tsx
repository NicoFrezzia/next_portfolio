            I&apos;m Nico Frezzia â€” a software developer and student passionate about creating
            modern, user-friendly applications that make life easier and more connected. I enjoy
            working on projects that bring together clean design, performance, and functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background includes experience with React Native, AWS, Spring Boot, and a range of
            backend and frontend technologies. I love learning new frameworks, improving user
            experiences, and building systems that solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of development, you&apos;ll often find me exploring creative ideas, mentoring peers,
            or working on side projects that mix technology with design and automation. I&apos;m always
            curious, always building, and always learning something new.

          When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing soccer, traveling, and capturing photos
          from my adventures. I also love tinkering with cars, filming creative projects, and
          learning about new technologies that push boundaries.
